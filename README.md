# Checkov Plugin for Jetbrains IDEA

[Checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov) is a static code analysis tool for infrastructure-as-code.

The Checkov Plugin for Intellij enables developers to get real-time scan results, as well as inline fix suggestions as they develop cloud infrastructure.


#TODO PLUGIN GIF DEMO
<!-- Plugin description -->

The plugin is currently available for download directly from the [IntelliJ Plugin Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17721-checkov) and its source code is available in an [Apache 2.0 licensed repository](link-to-license.com).

Activating the plugin requires submission of one-time Bridgecrew API Token that can be obtained by [creating a new Bridgecrew platform account](https://docs.bridgecrew.io/docs/get-api-token). It uses open [Bridgecrew Developer APIs](https://docs.bridgecrew.io/reference) to evaluate code and offer automated inline fixes. For more information about data shared with Bridgecrew see the [Disclaimer](#disclaimer) section below).

Plugin features include:

* [1000+ built-in policies](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov/blob/master/docs/5.Policy%20Index/all.md) covering security and compliance best practices for AWS, Azure and Google Cloud.
* Terraform, Terraform Plan, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, Helm, Serverless and ARM template scanning.
* Detects [AWS credentials](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov/blob/master/docs/2.Basics/Scanning%20Credentials%20and%20Secrets.md) in EC2 Userdata, Lambda environment variables and Terraform providers.
* In Terraform and CloudFormation checks support evaluation of arguments expressed in [variables](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov/blob/master/docs/2.Basics/Handling%20Variables.md) and remote modules to their actual values.
* Supports inline [suppression](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov/blob/master/docs/2.Basics/Suppressing%20and%20Skipping%20Policies.md) via comments.
* Links to policy descriptions, rationales as well as step by step instructions for fixing known misconfigurations.
* Fix suggestions for commonly misconfigured Terraform and CloudFormation attributes.


## Getting started

### Install

- Using IDE built-in plugin system:
  
  <kbd>Settings/Preferences</kbd> > <kbd>Plugins</kbd> > <kbd>Marketplace</kbd> > <kbd>Search for "checkov"</kbd> >
  <kbd>Install Plugin</kbd>
  
- Manually:

  Download the [latest release](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov-jetbrains-idea/releases/latest) and install it manually using
  <kbd>Settings/Preferences</kbd> > <kbd>Plugins</kbd> > <kbd>⚙️</kbd> > <kbd>Install plugin from disk...</kbd>


### Dependencies

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.7 or [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) daemon running

The Checkov plugin will invoke the latest version of ```Checkov```.

### Configuration

* Sign up to a Bridgecrew Community account [here](http://bridgecrew.cloud/). If you already have an account, sign in and go to the next step.

* From [Integrations](https://www.bridgecrew.cloud/integrations/api-token), select **API Token** and copy the API key.
* In Jetbrains, enter your API Token in the Checkov plugin settings page under tools.  
* Using a custom CA certificate is possible. If needed, set the path to the certificate file in the Checkov plugin settings page.

### Usage

* Open a file you wish to scan with checkov in IntelliJ.
* Checkov will run automatically everytime an IaC is opened or saved.
* Scan results should now appear in the checkov tool window in the bottom of your IDE.
* Scan results will appear on the left side as a tree of File Names -> Resources -> Violated checks.
* Click a check to see its details. Details including  violating policy and a link to step-by-step fix guidelines.
* In most cases, the Details will include a fix option. This will either add, remove or replace an unwanted configuration, based on the Checkov fix dictionaries.
* You can skip checks by adding an inline skip annotation ```checkov:skip=<check_id>:<suppression_comment>```. For more details see the [docs](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov/blob/master/docs/2.Concepts/Suppressions.md).
* To get Checkov results updated as you code you can configure the IDE to autosave modified files at regular time intervals.

### Troubleshooting logs

To access checkov-intellij logs directory, go to `Help` and select `Show Log in Finder` (for macOS) or `Show Log in Explorer` (for Windows).
